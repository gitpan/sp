SharePoint-SOAPHandler version 0.0011
================================

This module provides CopyTree::VendorProof a connector instance with methods to deal with remote Sharepoint file operations.

 IMPORTANT NOTICE: Your Implementation might not work unless you read the following!

Currenly, you need to install Authen::NTLM version 1.09 or greater for this module to work.  With my v1.09 tweak to Authen::NTLM on CPAN, this module should just work.  If you actually use Authen::NTLM directly for some reason, remember to set

ntlmv2('sp');

prior to using SharePoint::SOAPHandler.  You did remember to export ntlmv2, no?

use Authen::NTLM qw(ntlmv2);

For those of you with earlier versions of Authen::NTLM, see the historic segment below.
 
Also, if your Sharepoint connects through https, but does not go through a proxy server, even though all your OTHER http/ https traffic does, you must:

delete $ENV{'https_proxy'}

Specifying the domain on no_proxy will not do the trick, because oddly, no_proxy only works for 'no http' and not 'no https'.  These are just some annoying things I discovered.  Your milage may vary.

The methods provided in this connector objects include:
	new
	fdls				
	is_fd
	read_info_memory
	write_from_memory
	copy_local_files
	cust_mkdir
	cust_rmdir
	cust_rmfile

The functionality of these methods are described in 
perldoc CopyTree::VendorProof and 
perldoc SharePoint::SOAPHandler

To create a SharePoint::SOAPHandler connector instance:
	my $soaphandler_inst = SharePoint::SOAPHandler ->new;

	#set up connection parameters
	#IMPORTANT sp_creds_domain should not have the protocol (http or https://)
	$soaphandler_inst ->sp_creds_domain('www.sharepointsite.org:443');
	$soaphandler_inst ->sp_creds_user('DOMAIN_in_CAPs\username');
	$soaphandler_inst ->sp_creds_password('domain_password');
	$soaphandler_inst ->sp_authorizedroot('https://www.sharepointsite.org:443/some_dirs/the_dir_just_above_the_Shared_Documents_dir_that_you_are_allowed_to_edit');


To add a source or destination item to a CopyTree::VendorProof instance:
	my $ctvp_inst = CopyTree::VendorProof ->new;
	$ctvp_inst ->src ('some_source_path_of_local_file_system', $soaphandler_inst);
	$ctvp_inst ->dst ('some_destination_path_of_local_file_system', $soaphandler_inst);
	$ctvp_inst ->cp;

SharePoint::SOAPHandler, in adition to providing a connector instance to CopyTree::VendorProof, also provides some getlist funcions for sharepoint.  These functions are not extensively tested and are not recommended for use.

----historic----

Please note that as of July 2011, there is an NTLM bug that needs to be hacked for the sharepoint connector SharePoint::SPCOPY to work.  Basically, LWP automatically negotiates NTLM protocols, and calls its LWP::Authen::Ntlm to in turn call Authen::NTLM to authenticate against windows domains.  The problem is, sharepoint prefers an authentication between ntlmv2 and ntlmv1 that's offered by the Authen::NTLM package.  LWP::Authen::Ntlm does not specify any version.  This causes authentication to fail on sharepoint.  The web community offers a quick fix to 'patch' Authen::NTLM, which involves finding the Authen::NTLM module (perhaps in /usr/local/share/perl/5.10.1/Authen/NTLM.pm) and changing around line 289, where 

$domain =substr($challenge, $c_info->{domain}{offset}, $c_info->{domain}{len});

is to be changed to 

$domain = &unicode("domain");

This is CRITICALLY IMPORTANT if you want SharePoint::SOAPHandler to work.  I have created a patch that is a varient of this solution, but does not break backwards compatibility.  You can find this patch at 

https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=70703

Remember, either of these fixes must be applied for this module to work.  If the above instructions are unclear, please google http://shareperl.blogspot.com/2010/01/sharepoint-perl-connection.html.
